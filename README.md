Test case for Unico Studio.
I made some additions to the test scenario. The test scenario does not have a level loss condition, so I assumed that there should be a level loss when enemies cross the map, and in addition I added yellow rectangles over the defence areas to indicate their range.
Level data can be found in Assets/ScriptableData/Level.
Enemy and defender properties can be found in Assets/SriptableData/GameItems.
