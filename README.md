Test Case game for Unico Studio.

I made some additions to the test case. In test case there is no level loose condiiton so i assumed when enemies pass the map level should loose and in addition I add yellow rectangles above the defender areas for indicating their ranges.

Level data can be found in Assets/ScriptableData/Level.
Enemy and defender properties can be found in Assets/SriptableData/GameItems.
